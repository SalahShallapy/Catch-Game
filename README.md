# Catch the Falling Object Game

## Description

This is a simple **Python game** built using the `pygame` library. The objective is to catch falling objects (represented by a ball) with a movable paddle at the bottom of the screen. The player can move the paddle left and right to catch the ball, which increases speed as the game progresses.

This game was developed as part of an academic project for a **Python course**, and it serves as a fun way to practice basic Python programming concepts like game logic, user input handling, and graphical rendering.

Note
This project is part of my academic coursework for learning Python, and is not related to my main career focus as a web developer. I am learning Python as part of my Computer Science studies, and this project serves as a fun way to practice Python fundamentals like game logic and graphical programming.
